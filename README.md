# Los Alamos Makers Python Club
Code for the Los Alamos Makerspace weekly Python Club

We use Python 3.6+. [Installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is the easiest way to get Python.

Some weeks we follow the [How to Program: Computer Science Concepts and Python Exercises](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/how-to-program-computer-science-concepts-and-python-exercises.html) from Great Courses but most weeks we do coding exercises. The schedule is below and the code for the weeks are in their corresponding folder.
